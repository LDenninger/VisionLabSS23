# Experiment Template
This is a template directory structure for experiments with deep learning models.
It is intended to serve as the base for a new project.
Especially it is designed to be used with the [TorchGadgets](https://github.com/LDenninger/TorchGadgets), which provides a logger to log the experiments and further functionalities.
The API of TorchGadgets aims at working completely with config files which are separately handled within this template.
